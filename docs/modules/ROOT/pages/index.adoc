The https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html[*C2PA technical specification*] allows _<<_actor,actors>>_ in a workflow to make cryptographically signed _<<_c2pa_assertion,assertions>>_ about the produced _<<C2PA asset>>._ This signature is issued by the vendor whose software or hardware was used to create the _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>_ and the _<<C2PA claim>>,_ which is why it is called the _<<C2PA claim generator>>._

This specification describes a _<<C2PA assertion>>_ referred to here as the *identity assertion* that can be added to a _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ to enable a _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ to prove control over a digital identity and to use that identity to document their role in the _<<C2PA asset>>’s_ lifecycle.

== Introduction

_This section is non-normative._

=== Design goals

This specification aims to allow _<<_credential_subject,credential subjects>>_ to document their involvement in _<<_c2pa_asset,C2PA assets>>_ produced by them or on their behalf, and _<<_c2pa_manifest_consumer,consumers>>_ of those _<<_c2pa_asset,C2PA assets>>_ to independently verify that those received _<<_c2pa_asset,C2PA assets>>_ were in fact produced by the named _<<_credential_subject,credential subjects>>_ and have not been tampered with.

It accomplishes this by drawing upon and extending existing work from two standards organizations.

=== C2PA technical specification

The https://c2pa.org[Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)] has developed a https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html[technical specification] for providing content provenance and authenticity. It is designed to enable global, opt-in, adoption of digital provenance techniques through the creation of a rich ecosystem of digital provenance enabled applications for a wide range of individuals and organizations while meeting appropriate security requirements.

The C2PA technical specification allows other standards bodies to define additional metadata that can be incorporated into a _<<C2PA Manifest>>._ These statements come in the form of a _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertion>>._

This specification describes a specific _<<C2PA assertion>>_ that can be added to a _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ which allows a _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ to prove control over an digital identity and bind that identity to a _<<_c2pa_asset,C2PA asset>>_ produced by them or on their behalf.

=== Trust over IP technical architecture

The https://trustoverip.org[Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)] has developed a https://github.com/trustoverip/TechArch/blob/main/spec.md[technical architecture specification] for describing a decentralized digital trust infrastructure.

NOTE: This specification refers to a “public review draft” of the ToIP technical architecture specification published on 14 November 2022 which is current as of the writing of this specification.

The ToIP architecture specification introduces the concept of _<<_toip_verifiable_identifier,verifiable identifier>>_ as follows:

> Design Principle #5 (https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf[Cryptographic Verifiability]) states that “messages and data structures exchanged between parties should be verifiable as authentic using standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols”. This requires that Endpoint Systems be able to associate, discover and verify the cryptographic keys associated with a ToIP identifier. This specification will refer to identifiers that meet this basic requirement of cryptographic verifiability as verifiable identifiers (VIDs).
-- https://github.com/trustoverip/TechArch/blob/main/spec.md#64-toip-identifiers[Section 6.4: ToIP identifiers]

NOTE: The ToIP definition of the term “verifiable identifier” is well-aligned with the design goals of this specification. As of this writing, ToIP has just begun the process of producing a technical standard that describes how to _implement_ verifiable identifiers. This specification will incorporate relevant technical standards for verifiable identifiers as they become available.

This specification describes mechanisms to support two common individual and organizational identity mechanisms that fit the conceptual description of _<<ToIP verifiable identifier>>:_

* https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/[Decentralized identifiers (DIDs)] as defined by W3C, though support will be limited to specifically-chosen DID methods with wide adoption and independent verifiability.
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280[X.509 certificates]

=== Conceptual overview

Each identity assertion instance allows exactly one _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ to sign a list of _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>_ which will subsequently be included in a _<<C2PA claim>>._ This is intended to provide an additional trust signal over and above the signature provided by the _<<C2PA claim generator>>,_ as illustrated in the following diagram:

.Overview of identity assertion
image::overview.drawio.svg[Identity assertion overview,width=680,height=922,align="center"]

The _<<C2PA claim>>,_ which is signed by the _<<C2PA claim generator>>,_ contains a list of assertions which may contain any number of identity assertions.

Each identity assertion contains hashlink references to one or more other _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>_ and a signature from the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ over that list of hashlink references, thus providing a non-repudiable, tamper-evident binding between the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ and the list of assertions.

== Glossary

=== Concepts adapted from C2PA technical specification

The following definitions are adapted from the link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_glossary++[glossary] provided in the C2PA technical specification. This specification uses the prefix “C2PA” to denote data structures incorporated from that specification.

==== Actor

A human or non-human (hardware or software) that is participating in the C2PA ecosystem. For example: a camera (capture device), image editing software, cloud service, or the person using such tools.

NOTE: An organization or group of _actors_ may also be considered an _actor_ in the C2PA ecosystem.

NOTE: TO DO: Track upcoming definition change in C2PA spec.

==== C2PA asset

A file or stream of data containing _digital content,_ _asset metadata,_ and a <<C2PA Manifest>>.

For the purposes of this definition, we will extend the typical definition of “file” to include cloud-native and dynamically-generated data.

IMPORTANT: The definition of “C2PA asset” in this specification differs from the definition of “asset” given in the C2PA technical specification. A “C2PA asset” as defined in _this_ specification MUST contain a <<C2PA Manifest>>.

==== C2PA Manifest

The set of information about the _provenance_ of a _<<C2PA asset>>_ based on the combination of one or more _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>_ (including content bindings), a single _<<C2PA claim>>,_ and a _claim signature._ A _C2PA Manifest_ is part of a _C2PA Manifest Store._

NOTE: A _C2PA Manifest_ can reference other _C2PA Manifests._

See link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_manifests++[Section 12, “Manifests,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

==== C2PA claim

A digitally signed and tamper-evident data structure that references a set of _<<_c2pa_assertion,assertions>>_ by one or more _<<_actor,actors>>,_ concerning a _<<C2PA asset>>,_ and the information necessary to represent the content binding. If any _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>_ were redacted, then a declaration to that effect is included. This data is a part of the _<<C2PA Manifest>>._

See link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_claims++[Section 11, “Claims,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

==== C2PA claim generator

The non-human (hardware or software) _<<_actor,actor>>_ that generates the _<<C2PA claim>>_ about a _<<C2PA asset>>_ as well as the claim signature, thus leading to the _<<C2PA asset>>'s_ associated _<<C2PA Manifest>>._

==== C2PA assertion

A data structure which represents a statement asserted by an _<<_actor,actor>>_ concerning the _<<C2PA asset>>._ This data is a part of the _<<C2PA Manifest>>._

See link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_assertions++[Section 6, “Assertions,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

==== C2PA Manifest Consumer

An _<<_actor,actor>>_ who consumes a _<<_c2pa_asset,C2PA asset>>_ with an associated _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ for the purpose of obtaining the provenance data from the _<<C2PA Manifest>>._

NOTE: When this _<<_actor,actor>>_ is concerned with validating the identity assertions contained within a _<<C2PA Manifest>>,_ this role can also be thought of as a *relying party* or *verifier* as defined in specifications such as the link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifier++[W3C verifiable credentials data model].

=== Concepts adapted from ToIP technical architecture

The following definitions are adapted from the link:++https://github.com/trustoverip/TechArch/blob/v1-PR1/spec.md++[Trust over IP (ToIP) technology architecture specification]. This specification uses the prefix “ToIP” to denote concepts incorporated from that specification.

==== ToIP verifiable identifier

Any identifier for which an endpoint system is “able to associate, discover and verify the cryptographic keys associated with a ToIP identifier.” This satisfies the ToIP design principle that “messages and data structures exchanged between parties should be verifiable as authentic using standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols.”

See link:++https://github.com/trustoverip/TechArch/blob/v1-PR1/spec.md#64-toip-identifiers++[ToIP identifiers] in the ToIP technology architecture specification.

=== Concepts specific to this specification

==== Credential subject

An _<<_actor,actor>>_ that is identified by a _<<ToIP verifiable identifier>>._

NOTE: TO DO: Consider adding a section adapted from W3C VC data model, which would include this and other terms used throughout this spec.

==== Placeholder assertion

A temporary _<<C2PA assertion>>_ that is created during _<<C2PA claim>>_ generation which reserves space for the eventual content of identity assertion. A placeholder assertion MUST be used when the final file layout of the _<<C2PA asset>>_ is required for the content binding assertion.

== Assertion definition

=== Overview

The identity assertion contains the following data fields:

* `assertions` contains a list of assertions
* `signature` contains the raw byte stream of the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>’s_ signature
* `sig_type` defines the data type of signature
* `pad1` and `pad2` are zero-filled byte strings used to fill space

The content of `assertions` is a list of assertions which is presented to the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ for signature. This list of assertions MUST include a content binding assertion as described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hard_bindings++[Section 10.2, “Hard Bindings,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

For each assertion listed in the `assertions` field of the identity assertion, an assertion with the same `url`, `alg`, and `hash` values MUST also be listed in the `assertions` field of the _<<C2PA claim>>_ in which the identity assertion appears.

The `assertions` entry of the identity assertion MUST NOT reference the same identity assertion itself.

NOTE: The list of assertions in the `assertions` field of the identity assertion is necessarily a subset of the assertions listed in the `assertions` field of the _<<C2PA claim>>_ because the identity assertion may not refer to itself. The list of assertions may be further subsetted. For example, different _<<_credential_subject,credential subjects>>_ could attest to different assertions in a single _<<C2PA Manifest>>._

The `assertions` entry of the identity assertion MUST NOT reference any assertion more than once.

The `assertions` entry of an identity assertion MAY reference any other identity assertion. A _<<C2PA claim generator>>_ MUST NOT allow any two identity assertions to refer to each other directly or indirectly.

The content of `signature` depends on the type of credential that is used. Valid credential types and the corresponding `signature` data structures and `sig_type` values are defined in xref:_credentials_signatures_and_validation_methods[xrefstyle=full].

The identity assertion shall have a label of `cca.identity`. More than one identity assertion may appear in a _<<C2PA claim>>;_ if this occurs, these assertions shall be given unique labels as described by link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_multiple_instances++[Section 6.4, “Multiple instances,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

NOTE: Describe how to allow actors to describe their role in the content (previously described via CreativeWork assertion) and potentially in specific steps referenced in C2PA actions assertion.

NOTE: TO DO: Where would things like social media accounts live? Or should that be a separate assertion?

=== Schema and example

The schema for this type is defined by the `identity` rule in the following https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610[CDDL definition]:

[source,cddl]
----
identity = {
  "assertions": [1* $hashed-uri-map],
  "sig_type": tstr .size (1..max-tstr-length), ; A string identifying the data type of the signature field that follows. If the value of this string is not declared in this specification under (TO DO), this structure is invalid.
  "signature": bstr, ; byte string of the signature
  "pad1": bstr, ; zero-filled byte string used for filling up space
  ? "pad2": bstr, ; optional zero-filled byte string used for filling up space
}
----

The `hashed-uri-map` rule is defined in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hashed_uris++[Section 8.3, “Hashed URIs,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

An example in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#name-diagnostic-notation[CBOR-Diag] is shown below:

[source,json]

NOTE: TO DO: Prepare example.

== Creating the identity assertion

=== Presenting the list of assertions for signature

The list of assertions that will be included in the identity assertion MUST be presented to be signed by the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ corresponding to each identity assertion. The exact formatting of the list of assertions as presented to the signature method will depend on the nature of credential presented. These are described in xref:_credentials_signatures_and_validation_methods[xrefstyle=full].

=== Creating the assertion

IMPORTANT: If a data hash assertion is being used, the _<<C2PA claim generator>>_ MUST also follow the process described in xref:_interaction_with_data_hash_assertion[xrefstyle=full].

Once the signature is obtained, the identity assertion can be created and added to the C2PA Manifest's assertion store, and then referenced in the _<<C2PA claim>>._ If a _<<_placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion>>_ was previously added to the _<<_c2pa_claim,C2PA claim,>>_ its content MUST now be replaced with the final assertion content as described below.

The `assertions` field MUST contain the same list of assertions that was presented to the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ for signature.

The acceptable values for the `sig_type` and `signature` fields depend on the nature of credential used and are described in xref:_credentials_signatures_and_validation_methods[xrefstyle=full].

If a _<<placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion>>_ was used, the values of the `pad1` and `pad2` fields MUST now be recomputed (adjusted in size) such that the resulting identity assertion exactly matches the size in bytes of the _<<placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion.>>_ If the signature exceeds the space available in the _<<placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion,>>_ the claim generation process as described in xref:_interaction_with_data_hash_assertion[xrefstyle=full] MUST be repeated with a larger _<<_placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion>>._

NOTE: Preferred/deterministic CBOR serialization of byte arrays uses a variable-length integer to specify the length of the encoded binary data. When the length goes from zero to one byte, or one to two bytes (etc.), the length of the resulting pad jumps by two bytes. This means that not all paddings can be expressed using a single padding field. For example, 24-byte and 26-byte pads can be created, but a 25-byte pad cannot. If this situation arises, the desired padding can be split between `pad1` and `pad2`. For example, to make a 25-byte pad, an implementation can encode 19 bytes into `pad1` (resulting in an encoded length of 20 bytes), and 4 bytes into `pad2` (resulting in 5 bytes.)

If no _<<placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion>>_ was used, the values of the `pad1` and `pad2` fields MAY be empty.

The `pad1` and `pad2` fields of an identity assertion MUST contain only zero-value (`0x00`) bytes.

=== Interaction with data hash assertion

IMPORTANT: The process described in this section MUST be followed when using a data hash assertion as described by link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_data_hash++[Section 19.6, “Data hash assertion,”] of the C2PA technical specification. This process MAY be followed when using other content binding assertions.

The C2PA technical specification explains the need for pre-computing the _<<_c2pa_asset,C2PA asset’s>>_ final file layout when using a data hash assertion as follows:

> Some asset file formats require file offsets of the C2PA Manifest Store and asset content to be fixed before the manifest is signed, so that content bindings will correctly align with the content they authenticate. Unfortunately, the size of a manifest and its signature cannot be precisely known until after signing, which could cause file offsets to change. For example, in JPEG-1 files, the entire C2PA Manifest Store must appear in the file before the image data, and so its size will affect the file offsets of content being authenticated.
-- link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_multiple_step_processing++[Section 11.4: “Multiple step processing”]

Similarly, the size of the identity assertion cannot be known until its signature is obtained. Changing the size of the identity assertion after file layout is completed would invalidate the file offsets contained within the data hash assertion.

In this case, it is necessary to use a *<<_placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion>>* to reserve space for the content of the final identity assertion (including its signature) which will be created later.

When using a data hash assertion, a _<<C2PA claim generator>>_ MUST follow the process described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_creating_a_claim++[Section 11.3, “Creating a claim,”] and link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_multiple_step_processing++[Section 11.4, “Multiple step processing,”] of the C2PA technical specification with additional steps as described below:

1. link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_creating_assertions++[Section 11.3.1, “Creating assertions.”] Any identity assertion that will be added to the claim MUST be represented during this step by an assertion using the same label as the final identity assertion. The content of the _<<_placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion>>_ is unimportant, except that the size in bytes of the _<<_placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion>>_ MUST be large enough to accommodate the final identity assertion.
2. link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_adding_assertions_and_redactions++[Section 11.3.2.1, “Adding assertions and redactions”]

6. link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_create_content_bindings++[Section 11.4.2, “Create content bindings”]
7. The list of assertions (including the content binding assertion) MUST be presented to the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ for each identity assertion to be added, as described in xref:_presenting_the_list_of_assertions_for_signature[xrefstyle=full] by the corresponding _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>._ Once each signature has been obtained, the placeholder assertion content MUST be replaced with the final assertion content incorporating that signature.
8. The remaining steps from link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_multiple_step_processing++[Section 11.4, “Multiple step processing,”] MUST now be completed.
9. link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_signing_a_claim++[Section 11.3.2.4, “Signing a claim”]
10. link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_time_stamps++[Section 11.3.2.5, “Time stamps”]
11. link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_credential_revocation_information++[Section 11.3.2.6, “Credential revocation information”]

== Validating the identity assertion

An identity assertion is valid only if the _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ in which the assertion is contained is valid as defined by the section titled link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validation++[Section 16, “Validation,”] of the C2PA technical specification. Validation of the _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ MUST be completed with a successful result before a validator attempts to report on the validity of an identity assertion.

=== Validation method

An identity assertion MUST contain valid CBOR that satisfies the `identity` rule in xref:_schema_and_example[xrefstyle=full]. The `cca.identity.cbor.invalid` error code SHALL be used to report assertions that do not follow this rule.

For each entry in the `assertions` field, the validator MUST verify that the same entry exists in the `assertions` entry of the _<<C2PA claim>>._ The `cca.identity.assertion.mismatch` error code SHALL be used to report violations of this rule.

The validator MUST ensure that the `assertions` field contains at least one content binding assertion as described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hard_bindings++[Section 10.2, “Hard Bindings”] of the C2PA technical specification. The `cca.identity.content_binding_missing` error code SHALL be used to report a missing content binding.

The `sig_type` field of an identity assertion MUST contain one of the values described in xref:_credentials_signatures_and_validation_methods[xrefstyle=full]. The `cca.identity.sig_type.invalid` error code SHALL be used to report assertions that contain unrecognized values.

The `pad1` and `pad2` fields of an identity assertion MUST contain only zero-value (`0x00`) bytes. The `cca.identity.pad.invalid` error code SHALL be used to report assertions that contain other values in these fields.

=== Status codes

The set of standard success and failure codes for identity assertion validations are defined below. These follow the format defined by the section titled link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_status_codes++[Section 16.1, “Status codes,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

The `url` field for a status code MUST always be the label of the identity assertion. It is omitted from the tables below.

==== Success codes

[width="100%",cols="4,10",options="header"]
|=======================
| Value        |   Meaning
|`cca.identity.validated` | The identity assertion, including the referenced credentials and signature binding the credential holder to the _<<C2PA claim>>_, is validated.
|=======================

==== Failure codes

[width="100%",cols="4,10",options="header"]
|=======================
| Value        |   Meaning
|`cca.identity.cbor.invalid` | The CBOR of the identity assertion is not valid.
|`cca.identity.assertion.mismatch` | The identity assertion contains an assertion reference that could not be found in the _<<C2PA claim>>.
|`cca.identity.content_binding_missing` | The identity assertion does not reference a content binding assertion.
|`cca.identity.sig_type.invalid` | The `sig_type` of the identity assertion is not valid.
|`cca.identity.pad.invalid` | The `pad1` or `pad2` field contains non-zero bytes.
|=======================

NOTE: Additional failure codes relating to specific signature types are defined in xref:_credentials_signatures_and_validation_methods[xrefstyle=full].

== Credentials, signatures, and validation methods

The identity assertion allows multiple signature types to be represented, although only one _<<ToIP verifiable identifier>>_ and corresponding signature can be used in any single assertion.

The signature type is represented by the `sig_type` field and must be one of the values described within this section.

=== W3C verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations

IMPORTANT: TO DO: *Major discussion item:* I think there are reasonable cases for the content of the identity assertion to be a new Verifiable Credential and also for it to be a Verifiable Presentation. The VC path will resolve some of the redundant-chain-of-trust issues identified below, but may complicate the signing experience for wallet-based applications.

In some use cases, an _<<_actor,actor>>_ in the system may wish to provide its own _https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/[W3C verifiable credential],_ as it exists at that moment in time, to the _<<C2PA claim generator>>_ to have it associated with one or more _<<_c2pa-assertion,C2PA assertions>>._ This _<<_actor,actor>>_ may be an individual, group, or organization.

The _<<_actor,actor>>_’s _verifiable credential_ is combined with a _verifiable credential_ for the _<<C2PA claim>>_ into a _link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0++[W3C verifiable presentation]._

NOTE: TO DO: We’re no longer having the VC subject sign even a partial claim, but a list of assertions. Need to think through exactly what we’re presenting to the VC holder and how we describe it.

NOTE: TO DO: Discuss whether the VC for the claim is necessary. I’ve heard some feedback that having a VC for the claim would make it easier for a wallet application to have suitable information to present when fulfulling the presentation request. A counter-concern is that this is effectively redundant and would require the claim-generator’s identity to be expressed both in X.509 and VC. Need to balance these concerns.

The `sig_type` value for such an assertion MUST be `org.w3.verifiable_presentation` and the `signature` value MUST be the _verifiable presentation_ serialized as described in link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-ld++[Section 6.2, “JSON-LD,”] of the W3C verifiable credentials data model spec.

NOTE: TO DO: Is JSON-LD still required/preferred? I’ve heard some feedback that there may be less consensus around this now.

NOTE: JSON-LD serialization is mandated as it is the most commonly used of the three syntaxes presented in link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#syntaxes++[Section 6, “Syntaxes,”] of the W3C verifiable credentials specification. It is also the one that aligns best with its extensibility model, which could be useful to some implementers.

==== Verifiable credential for actor

NOTE: TO DO: Reconsider the following statement from C2PA 1.3 spec. Since we’re shifting to verifiable presentations, I think we want to make a stronger statement to indicate that the actor _did_ authorize the assertions.

[quote]
____
W3C verifiable credentials are used in this specification to decorate the actors identified in assertions with more information, potentially providing additional trust signals. Although these W3C verifiable credentials can include proofs of their own authenticity, they are *not* a mechanism for verifying that a particular actor authorised a claim, assertion or piece of metadata. Any validation or usage of the W3C cerifiable credential is out of scope of this specification and has no bearing on the link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_trust_model++[C2PA Trust Model].

For example, conveying a W3C verifiable credential for the actor identified as the `author` in an assertion might link that author’s ID with an email address, social media ID, or real name, or it might identify that actor as a member of a particular professional body, or provide other qualifications relevant to the actor’s involvement in the asset.

NOTE: TO DO: Build a new example of a compliant credential.

A _verifiable credential_ used with an identity assertion MUST contain only a single `credentialSubject` and that `credentialSubject` shall have an `id` value, which MUST be a valid _https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/[W3C decentralized identifier]._

As defined in link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods++[Section 8, “Methods,”] of the W3C decentralized identifier spec, a _DID method_ defines how implementers can create, resolve, update, and deactivate DIDs and DID documents.

All _W3C decentralized identifiers_ that are stored in an identity assertion SHALL be generated using one of the _DID methods_ as described in this section. This section defines both:

* A list of _DID methods_ that are allowed for generating identifiers for new content as well as required for validating identifiers of existing content (the allowed list), and
* A list of _DID methods_ that are required to be supported for validating identifiers of existing content but are not allowed for generating identifiers for new content (the deprecated list).

A _DID method_ MUST appear in no more than one list. If a DID method does not appear in either list, it is forbidden and MUST NOT be used or supported. Algorithms can be removed from the lists in order to implement forbidding an algorithm. For this reason, implementations MUST NOT support additional algorithms on an optional basis.

NOTE: TO DO: Is the strict prohibition necessary in this case?

Implementers SHOULD consult this section in the current version of the specification when releasing software updates and ensure their supported algorithms conform to it.

The allowed list is:

* https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/[`did:web`]
* https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-did-method-webs-specification/[`did:webs`]

The deprecated list is empty.

==== Credential security considerations

NOTE: TO DO: Review the following statement adapted from C2PA spec. I think it’s at odds with the use of DID documents, and should likely be removed.

> In most W3C verifiable credential workflows, the information about the subject (e.g., the cryptographic keys) is fetched on demand at the time of validation. While that is an acceptable model, it does open up a possible attack vector by providing an attacker with an externally-visible signal about what the validator is validating. Therefore, this specification also supports having the information captured and embedded at the time of signature. This not only prevents leakage, but also makes it very clear what data the signer is asserting about the credential’s subject. 

==== Verifiable credential for list of assertions

NOTE: TO DO: Describe how to create VC for the list of assertions. Depends on outcome of TO DO item earlier regarding whether this VC is necessary and what we call the list of assertions.

==== Verifiable presentation

NOTE: TO DO: Describe how to create the VP from the above two credentials.

==== Verifying the verifiable presentation

NOTE: TO DO: Write up verification procedures.

=== X.509 certificates and COSE signatures

In some use cases, an _<<_actor,actor>>_ in the system may wish to provide an _https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280[X.509 certificate]_ to have an organizational or individual identity described by the certificate associated with the list of _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>._

The `sig_type` value for such an assertion MUST be `org.ietf.cose`. The `signature` value MUST be a _https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152[COSE signature]_ as described below.

==== Generating the COSE signature

To generate the COSE signature for an identity assertion, the steps described in the listed sections of the C2PA technical specification MUST be followed with adaptations as described subsequently:

* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_signing_a_claim++[Section 11.3.2.4, “Signing a claim”]
* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_time_stamps++[Section 11.3.2.5, “Time-stamps”]
* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_credential_revocation_information++[Section 11.3.2.6, “Credential revocation information”]
* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hashing_2++[Section 14.1, “Hashing”]
* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_digital_signatures++[Section 14.2, “Digital signatures”]

In each of the above sections, the following changes MUST be applied:

* Any reference to the _claim_ MUST be replaced with the CBOR serialization of the `assertions` field from the identity assertion.
* Any reference to the _claim generator_ MUST be replaced with the _<<_actor,actor>>_ whose _X.509 certificate_ is being used for this assertion.

[NOTE]
.TO DO: Review C2PA spec for additional adaptions that might be relevant.
====
* Is the EKU usage still valid for this purpose?
* Is the trust list the same?
====

==== Validating the COSE signature

NOTE: TO DO: Write this section. Similar to the generation section, I expect it will largely leverage the C2PA spec.

== Trust model

IMPORTANT: This section augments link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_trust_model++[Section 15, “Trust model,”] of the C2PA spec by adding additional trust signals related to the identity of _<<_actor,actors>>_ involved in creation of a _<<C2PA asset>>._ It does not replace any portion of the C2PA trust model.

[NOTE]
TO DO: Add language here that clarifies that the identity assertion introduces a second trust triangle, distinct from the trust triangle including the _claim generator,_ that enables the C2PA Manifest Consumer to make trust decisions regarding the _actor_ whose credential was used to generate the signature in this identity assertion.

[NOTE]
.TO DO: Describe the trust signals that are intended to be conveyed by this assertion. Adapt from or possibly reference the following documents:
====
* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_trust_model++[15. Trust model] in C2PA technical specification
* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/security/Security_Considerations.html#_trust_model++[2.2 Trust model] in C2PA security considerations
* link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#ecosystem-overview++[1.2 Ecosystem Overview] in W3C verifiable credentials spec
* link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#use-cases-and-requirements++[1.3 Use Cases and Requirements] in W3C verifiable credentials spec

== User experience

_This section is non-normative._

[NOTE]
.TO DO:
====
* Think through wallet-holder experience challenges, especially when batch-producing assets.
* Think through async issues and online failure cases involved in verifying VC/DID document chains.
====

== Open issues / discussion

_This section is non-normative._

Resolve the following topics before producing a 1.0 version of this spec:

* How to express the credential holder’s role in relation to the manifest or specific actions in the manifest? The now-deprecated `stds.schema-org.CreativeWork` assertion offered many options.
** Related: Describe how to allow other assertions to refer to _this_ assertion. (TO DO: Now that the identity assertion is countersigning a list of assertions, is this still necessary?)
* Think through what information needs to be presented to wallet/credential holder so that the wallet can provide a suitable user experience. This likely requires that the asset itself has a credential and a suitable credential schema, which will likely need to incorporate a summary of actions and ingredients. (Can a small thumbnail be included as well?)
* Find a home for following statement, adapted from 1.3 C2PA spec: Since an identity assertion can contain personally identifiable information, there may be workflows where it is necessary to remove/redact an identity assertion. This can be accomplished by following the workflow described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_redaction_of_assertions++[Section 6.7, “Redaction of assertions,”] of the C2PA technical specification.
* Is it appropriate to include proper methods of creating an identity attestation and the associated levels of assurance? E.g. ID confirmation proxy (via telco data, credit bureau, bankID, etc) as level 1, KYC-style document verification or mDL as level 2, and gov't-issued RFID chip confirmation level 3, as an example? 
* Is there a requirement for an end-user (e.g. twitter scrolling end-user) to verify the veracity of the VP? Is there a requirement for twitter to be able to verify? By verify, I mean check the cryptography and confirm provenance.
