The link:https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html[*C2PA technical specification*] allows _<<_actor,actors>>_ in a workflow to make cryptographically signed _<<_c2pa_assertion,assertions>>_ about the produced _<<C2PA asset>>._ This signature is issued by the vendor whose software or hardware was used to create the _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>_ and the _<<C2PA claim>>,_ which is why it is called the _<<C2PA claim generator>>._

This specification describes a _<<C2PA assertion>>_ referred to here as the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* that can be added to a _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ to enable a _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ to prove control over a digital identity and to use that identity to document their role in the _<<C2PA asset>>’s_ lifecycle.

== Introduction

_This section is non-normative._

=== Scope

This specification describes a _<<C2PA assertion>>_ that allows an _<<_actor,actor>>_ to document their relationship to a _<<C2PA asset>>_ produced by them or on their behalf independently from the _<<C2PA claim generator>>,_ and to allow _<<_c2pa_manifest_consumer,consumers>>_ of a _<<C2PA asset>>_ to independently verify that the received asset was in fact produced by the named _<<_actor,actor>>_ and has not been tampered with.

IMPORTANT: For purposes of the Community Specification License, the link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/blob/main/scope.md[scope.md document] at the root of this project’s GitHub repository is the governing document of this specification’s scope.

This specification draws upon and extends existing work from two standards organizations:

=== C2PA technical specification

The https://c2pa.org[Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)] has developed a link:https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html[technical specification] for providing content provenance and authenticity. It is designed to enable global, opt-in, adoption of digital provenance techniques through the creation of a rich ecosystem of digital provenance enabled applications for a wide range of individuals and organizations while meeting appropriate security requirements.

The C2PA technical specification allows other standards bodies to define additional metadata that can be incorporated into a _<<C2PA Manifest>>._ These statements come in the form of a _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertion>>._

This specification describes a specific _<<C2PA assertion>>_ that can be added to a _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ to allow an _<<_actor,actor>>_ to prove control over an digital identity and to bind that identity to a _<<_c2pa_asset,C2PA asset>>_ (and, at their option, one or more _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>_) produced by them or on their behalf.

IMPORTANT: This document references link:https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html[version 2.0 of the C2PA technical specification], but it is also compatible with all 1.x versions of the specification. Where there is a meaningful difference between versions of the C2PA specification, those will be described here.

=== Trust over IP technical architecture

The https://trustoverip.org[Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)] has developed a https://github.com/trustoverip/TechArch/blob/main/spec.md[technical architecture specification] for describing a decentralized digital trust infrastructure.

NOTE: This specification refers to a “public review draft” of the ToIP technical architecture specification published on 14 November 2022 which is current as of the writing of this specification.

The ToIP architecture specification introduces the concept of _<<_toip_verifiable_identifier,verifiable identifier>>_ as follows:

> Design Principle #5 (https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf[Cryptographic Verifiability]) states that “messages and data structures exchanged between parties should be verifiable as authentic using standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols”. This requires that Endpoint Systems be able to associate, discover and verify the cryptographic keys associated with a ToIP identifier. This specification will refer to identifiers that meet this basic requirement of cryptographic verifiability as verifiable identifiers (VIDs).
-- https://github.com/trustoverip/TechArch/blob/main/spec.md#64-toip-identifiers[Section 6.4: ToIP identifiers]

NOTE: The ToIP definition of the term “verifiable identifier” is well-aligned with the design goals of this specification. As of this writing, ToIP has just begun the process of producing a technical standard that describes how to _implement_ verifiable identifiers. This specification will incorporate relevant technical standards for verifiable identifiers as they become available.

This specification describes mechanisms to support two common individual and organizational identity mechanisms that fit the conceptual description of _<<ToIP verifiable identifier>>:_

* https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/[Decentralized identifiers (DIDs)] as defined by W3C
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280[X.509 certificates]

=== Conceptual overview

Each *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* instance allows exactly one _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ to sign a list of _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>_ which will subsequently be included in a _<<C2PA claim>>._ The _<<_credential_subject,credential subject’s>>_ signature should generally be construed as reflective of the subject’s authorization of or active participation in the production of the the _<<C2PA asset>>_ in which it appears, as described by the specific _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>_ that are referenced in the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*

This is intended to provide an additional trust signal over and above the signature provided by the _<<C2PA claim generator>>,_ as illustrated in the following diagram, which is non-normative:

.Overview of identity assertion
image::overview.drawio.svg[Identity assertion overview,width=680,height=878,align="center"]

The _<<C2PA claim>>,_ which is signed by the _<<C2PA claim generator>>,_ contains a list of assertions which may contain any number of *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertions>>.*

Each *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* contains hashlink references to one or more other _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>,_ known here as _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>,_ and a signature from the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ over that list of hashlink references, thus providing a non-repudiable, tamper-evident binding between the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ and the list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>._

This trust signal may be repeated any number of times to convey information specific to distinct _<<_credential_subject,credential subjects>>._ The following diagram, which is non-normative, illustrates two _<<_credential_subject,credential subjects>>,_ each independently signing different actions and metadata assertions:

.Example with multiple identity assertions

=== Use cases and examples

The following is a non-exhaustive list of potential and general use cases for the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.* Some of these are taken from, or built upon, the use cases developed within the link:https://www.originproject.info/[Project Origin Alliance] and the link:https://contentauthenticity.org/[Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI)] frameworks. Each use case will be described using some generic personas to help make the flow clear.

==== Enhancing clarity around provenance and edits for journalistic work

A photojournalist Alice uses a Content Credentials-enabled capture device during a newsworthy event she is covering. Her capture device is configured with her professional credentials and records her identity in each captured asset. She then imports these assets into a Content Credentials-enabled editing application. Her identity is again associated with the edits that she has made. After editing, she sends her assets to her photo editor, Bob. Bob makes additional edits also using a Content Credentials-enabled application. A new identity assertion is recorded for these edits identifying Bob as the person responsible for those edits. The finalized asset is moved into the content management system of a news organization, which is also Content Credentials-enabled, before posting the asset to social media. Anyone viewing these assets can see the identity of Alice, Bob, and the news organization in a Content Credentials-enabled viewer.

==== Enhance the evidentiary value of critical footage

A human rights defender Jane manages to capture footage containing Content Credentials-enabled provenance of violence during a protest. Jane’s capture device is configured with her professional credentials and records her identity in each captured asset. Jane sends the footage to a human rights organization that verifies that the asset meets video-as-evidence criteria. The human rights organization determines that releasing Jane’s identity to the public could pose a safety or privacy risk, so they redact the identity assertion using a Content Credentials-enabled editing application before publishing the footage.

==== Election integrity and protecting political campaigns from deepfakes

Aarav is the director of social communications for a political candidate in an upcoming election. He feels concerned that in efforts to manipulate voters, bad actors will create deepfake videos to misrepresent the candidate. To protect the campaign, Aarav decides that all official communications will be created, produced, and published with Content Credentials-enabled tools. The identity assertion equips Aarav and his team with the ability to represent the campaign as the organizational owner of the content that they publish. Aarav encourages voters to verify any digital campaign content to ensure that the material has Content Credentials that link the assets to the campaign.

==== Brand protection in digital marketing

An advertising agency representing a popular sneaker brand wants to ensure that consumers are only purchasing the shoes through official channels. They have found several fraudulent campaigns online claiming to offer the shoes at a discount. To address these scams, the agency decides to incorporate Content Credentials into their creative process, using the identity assertion to represent the designer responsible for the campaign. Before the campaign goes live, the agency redacts the designer’s name and publishes the assets with Content Credentials using the identity assertion to represent the sneaker brand. Now consumers can refer to Content Credentials to identify legitimate promotional campaigns from the sneaker brand.

==== Attribution for digital creators

One morning, Charlie, an up-and-coming digital artist, woke up to find that one of their designs went viral on social media. Charlie felt upset to see their art detached from their name. Charlie had spent months working on their artwork and was disappointed not to receive credit or compensation for their work. Moving forward, Charlie decides to use the identity assertion to link their name, social media, and copyright information to the art they create. Now, when Charlie posts their content to social media platforms that display Content Credentials, viewers can easily link the artwork back to Charlie.

==== Audio sampling and artistic collaboration

Eve is a musician with a talent for releasing songs featuring clever lyrics and catchy beats. Ever since Eve’s music gained traction on audio streaming apps, artists have reached out asking permission to sample her beats. Eve views these collaborations as an opportunity to help new listeners discover her music, so it is important to her that the samples are traceable back to her. She decides to begin recording her songs using a Content Credentials-enabled device configured with her identity and her profile on music streaming applications. Now, when other artists release songs that sample Eve’s tunes, she can demonstrate her contribution to the final work.

== Terms and definitions

=== Concepts adapted from C2PA technical specification

The following definitions are adapted from the link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_glossary++[glossary] provided in the C2PA technical specification. This specification uses the prefix “C2PA” to denote data structures incorporated from that specification.

==== Actor

A human or non-human (hardware or software) that is participating in the C2PA ecosystem. For example: a camera (capture device), image editing software, cloud service, or the person using such tools.

NOTE: An organization or group of _actors_ may also be considered an _actor_ in the C2PA ecosystem.

==== C2PA asset

A file or stream of data containing _digital content,_ _asset metadata,_ and a <<C2PA Manifest>>.

For the purposes of this definition, we will extend the typical definition of “file” to include cloud-native and dynamically-generated data.

IMPORTANT: The definition of “C2PA asset” in this specification differs from the definition of “asset” given in the C2PA technical specification. A “C2PA asset” as defined in _this_ specification MUST contain a <<C2PA Manifest>>.

==== C2PA Manifest

The set of information about the _provenance_ of a _<<C2PA asset>>_ based on the combination of one or more _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>_ (including _<<_content_binding,content bindings>>_), a single _<<C2PA claim>>,_ and a _claim signature._ A _C2PA Manifest_ is part of a _C2PA Manifest Store._

NOTE: A _C2PA Manifest_ can reference other _C2PA Manifests._

See link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_manifests++[Section 11, “Manifests,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

==== C2PA claim

A digitally signed and tamper-evident data structure that references a set of _<<_c2pa_assertion,assertions>>_ by one or more _<<_actor,actors>>,_ concerning a _<<C2PA asset>>,_ and the information necessary to represent the _<<_content_binding,content binding>>._ If any _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>_ were redacted, then a declaration to that effect is included. This data is a part of the _<<C2PA Manifest>>._

See link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_claims++[Section 10, “Claims,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

==== C2PA claim generator

The non-human (hardware or software) _<<_actor,actor>>_ that generates the _<<C2PA claim>>_ about a _<<C2PA asset>>_ as well as the claim signature, thus leading to the _<<C2PA asset>>'s_ associated _<<C2PA Manifest>>._

==== C2PA assertion

A data structure which represents a statement asserted by an _<<_actor,actor>>_ concerning the _<<C2PA asset>>._ This data is a part of the _<<C2PA Manifest>>._

See link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_assertions++[Section 6, “Assertions,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

==== C2PA Manifest Consumer

An _<<_actor,actor>>_ who consumes a _<<_c2pa_asset,C2PA asset>>_ with an associated _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ for the purpose of obtaining the provenance data from the _<<C2PA Manifest>>._

NOTE: When this _<<_actor,actor>>_ is concerned with validating the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertions>>* contained within a _<<C2PA Manifest>>,_ this role can also be thought of as a *relying party* or *verifier* as defined in specifications such as the link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifier++[W3C verifiable credentials data model].

==== Content binding

Information that associates digital content to a specific _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ associated with a specific _<<C2PA asset>>,_ either as a _hard binding_ or a _soft binding._

Content bindings are described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_binding_to_content++[Section 9, “Binding to content,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

==== Hard binding

One or more cryptographic hashes that uniquely identifies either the entire _<<C2PA asset>>_ or a portion thereof.

Hard bindings are described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hard_bindings++[Section 9.2, “Hard bindings,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

=== Concepts adapted from W3C verifiable credentials specification

The following definitions are adapted from the link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#terminology++[W3C verifiable credentials data model] specification, version 1.1. This specification uses the prefix “W3C” to denote concepts incorporated from that specification.

==== W3C verifiable credential

A tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified.

==== W3C decentralized identifier

A portable URL-based identifier, also known as a *DID,* associated with an entity. These identifiers are most often used in a _<<W3C verifiable credential>>_ and are associated with subjects such that a _<<W3C verifiable credential>>_ itself can be easily ported from one repository to another without the need to reissue the _<<W3C verifiable credential>>_. An example of a DID is `did:example:123456abcdef`.

==== W3C decentralized identifier document

Also referred to as a *DID document,* this is a document that is accessible using a verifiable data registry and contains information related to a specific _<<W3C decentralized identifier>>,_ such as the associated repository and public key information.

=== Concepts adapted from ToIP technical architecture

The following definitions are adapted from the link:++https://github.com/trustoverip/TechArch/blob/v1-PR1/spec.md++[Trust over IP (ToIP) technology architecture specification]. This specification uses the prefix “ToIP” to denote concepts incorporated from that specification.

==== ToIP verifiable identifier

Any identifier for which an endpoint system is “able to associate, discover and verify the cryptographic keys associated with a ToIP identifier.” This satisfies the ToIP design principle that “messages and data structures exchanged between parties should be verifiable as authentic using standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols.”

See link:++https://github.com/trustoverip/TechArch/blob/v1-PR1/spec.md#64-toip-identifiers++[ToIP identifiers] in the ToIP technology architecture specification.

=== Concepts specific to this specification

==== Credential subject

The _<<_actor,actor>>_ that is identified by the *subject* field of a _<<ToIP verifiable identifier>>._

==== Identity assertion

A _<<C2PA assertion>>_ that allows a _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ to prove control over an digital identity and bind that identity to a set of _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>_ produced by them or on their behalf.

==== Placeholder assertion

A temporary _<<C2PA assertion>>_ that is created during _<<C2PA claim>>_ generation which reserves space for the eventual content of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.* A placeholder assertion MUST be used when the final file layout of the _<<C2PA asset>>_ is required for the _<<_hard_binding,hard binding>>_ assertion, as described in xref:_interaction_with_data_hash_assertion[xrefstyle=full].

==== Referenced assertions

The set of _<<_c2pa_assertion,C2PA assertions>>_ that are referenced by an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* and thus bound to (i.e. authorized by or created by) the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ named in the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*

include::partial$terms.adoc[]

== Assertion definition

=== Overview

This specification defines a _<<C2PA assertion>>_ known as an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* which MAY be used to bind one _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ to a set of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>._ This binding SHOULD generally be construed as authorization of or participation in the creation of the statements described those assertions and corresponding portions of the _<<C2PA asset>>_ in which they appear.

The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* contains the following data fields:

* `referenced_assertions` contains a list of assertions that are referenced and signed by this _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_
* `signature` contains the raw byte stream of the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>’s_ signature
* `sig_type` defines the data type of signature
* `pad1` and `pad2` are zero-filled byte strings used to fill space

The content of `referenced_assertions` is a list of assertions which is presented to the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ for signature. This list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>_ MUST include a _<<hard_binding,hard binding>>_ assertion as described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hard_bindings++[Section 9.2, “Hard bindings,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

IMPORTANT: A single signature from the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ covers the _list_ of assertions. An implementation MUST NOT present each assertion separately for signature.

For each assertion listed in the `referenced_assertions` field of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* an assertion with the same `url`, `alg`, and `hash` values MUST also be listed in the `assertions` field of the _<<C2PA claim>>_ in which the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* appears.

NOTE: The list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>_ in the `referenced_assertions` field of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* is necessarily a subset of the assertions listed in the `assertions` field of the _<<C2PA claim>>_ because the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* may not refer to itself. The list of assertions may be further subsetted. For example, different _<<_credential_subject,credential subjects>>_ could attest to different assertions in a single _<<C2PA Manifest>>._

Multiple identity assertions may be used in the same _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ to describe the distinct roles of multiple _<<_actor,actors>>_ in creating a single _<<C2PA asset>>._ This is illustrated in the xref:multiple-identity-assertions[multi-author example] from the conceptual overview.

The `referenced_assertions` entry of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* MUST NOT reference any assertion more than once.

The `referenced_assertions` entry of an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* MAY reference any other *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.* Since every assertion referenced by an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* must not change once presented to the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ for signature, care must be taken to ensure that no *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* references itself and that no cycle of references among *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertions>>* is created.

The content of `signature` depends on the type of credential that is used. Valid credential types and the corresponding `signature` data structures and `sig_type` values are defined in xref:_credentials_signatures_and_validation_methods[xrefstyle=full].

The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* shall have a label of `cawg.identity`. More than one *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* may appear in a _<<C2PA claim>>;_ if this occurs, these assertions shall be given unique labels as described by link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_multiple_instances++[Section 6.4, “Multiple instances,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

=== Schema and example

The schema for this type is defined by the `identity` rule in the following https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610[CDDL definition]:

[source,cddl]
----
identity = {
  "referenced_assertions": [1* $hashed-uri-map],
  "sig_type": tstr .size (1..max-tstr-length), ; A string identifying the data type of the signature field that follows
  "signature": bstr, ; byte string of the signature
  "pad1": bstr, ; zero-filled byte string used for filling up space
  ? "pad2": bstr, ; optional zero-filled byte string used for filling up space
}
----

The `sig_type` field MUST contain a value described in xref:_credentials_signatures_and_validation_methods[xrefstyle=full].

The `hashed-uri-map` rule is defined in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.3/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hashed_uris++[Section 8.3.1, “Hashed URIs,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

An example in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#name-diagnostic-notation[CBOR-Diag] is shown below, which is non-normative:

[source,json]
----
{
  "referenced_assertions" : [
    {
      "url": "self#jumbf=c2pa/urn:uuid:F9168C5E-CEB2-4faa-B6BF-329BF39FA1E4/c2pa.assertions/c2pa.hash.data",
      "hash": b64'U9Gyz05tmpftkoEYP6XYNsMnUbnS/KcktAg2vv7n1n8='
    },

}
----

== Creating the identity assertion

=== Presenting the list of referenced assertions for signature

Prior to requesting the credential holder with the list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>_ for signature, the assertions to be signed MUST themselves be created. This process is described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_creating_assertions#_creating_assertions++[Section 10.3.1, “Creating assertions,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

The list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>_ MUST include the same _<<_hard_binding,hard binding>>_ assertion that is present in the _<<C2PA claim>>_ itself. The list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>_ SHOULD include any _<<_c2pa_assertion,assertions>>_ necessary to allow the _<<_actor,actor>>_ to accurately describe their relationship to the content. For example, a `c2pa.actions` assertion could be referenced to attest that the _<<_actor,actor>>_ performed those specific actions.

The list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>_ MUST be presented to be signed by the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ corresponding to each *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.* This process is described in more detail in xref:_credentials_signatures_and_validation_methods[xrefstyle=full].

IMPORTANT: If a data hash assertion is being used, the _<<C2PA claim generator>>_ MUST also follow the process described in xref:_interaction_with_data_hash_assertion[xrefstyle=full].

=== Creating the assertion

Once the signature is obtained, the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* can be created and added to the C2PA Manifest's assertion store, and then referenced in the _<<C2PA claim>>._ If a _<<_placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion>>_ was previously added to the _<<_c2pa_claim,C2PA claim,>>_ its content MUST now be replaced with the final assertion content as described below.

The `referenced_assertions` field MUST contain the same list of assertions that was presented to the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ for signature.

The acceptable values for the `sig_type` and `signature` fields depend on the nature of credential used and are described in xref:_credentials_signatures_and_validation_methods[xrefstyle=full].

The _<<C2PA claim generator>>_ SHOULD independently validate the signature from the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ before proceeding.

If a _<<placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion>>_ was used, the values of the `pad1` and `pad2` fields MUST now be recomputed (adjusted in size) such that the resulting *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* exactly matches the size in bytes of the _<<placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion.>>_ If the signature exceeds the space available in the _<<placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion,>>_ the claim generation process as described in xref:_interaction_with_data_hash_assertion[xrefstyle=full] MUST be repeated with a larger _<<_placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion>>._

NOTE: Preferred/deterministic CBOR serialization of byte arrays uses a variable-length integer to specify the length of the encoded binary data. When the length goes from zero to one byte, or one to two bytes (etc.), the length of the resulting pad jumps by two bytes. This means that not all paddings can be expressed using a single padding field. For example, 24-byte and 26-byte pads can be created, but a 25-byte pad cannot. If this situation arises, the desired padding can be split between `pad1` and `pad2`. For example, to make a 25-byte pad, an implementation can encode 19 bytes into `pad1` (resulting in an encoded length of 20 bytes), and 4 bytes into `pad2` (resulting in 5 bytes.)

If no _<<placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion>>_ was used, the values of the `pad1` and `pad2` fields MAY be empty.

The `pad1` and `pad2` fields of an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* MUST contain only zero-value (`0x00`) bytes.

=== Interaction with data hash assertion

IMPORTANT: The process described in this section MUST be followed when using a data hash assertion as described by link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_data_hash++[Section 18.5, “Data hash,”] of the C2PA technical specification. This process MAY be followed when using other _<<_hard_binding,hard binding>>_ assertions.

The C2PA technical specification explains the need for pre-computing the _<<_c2pa_asset,C2PA asset’s>>_ final file layout when using a data hash assertion as follows:

> Some asset file formats require file offsets of the C2PA Manifest Store and asset content to be fixed before the manifest is signed, so that _<<_hard_binding,hard bindings>>_ will correctly align with the content they authenticate. Unfortunately, the size of a manifest and its signature cannot be precisely known until after signing, which could cause file offsets to change. For example, in JPEG-1 files, the entire C2PA Manifest Store must appear in the file before the image data, and so its size will affect the file offsets of content being authenticated.
-- link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_multiple_step_processing++[Section 10.4: “Multiple step processing”]

Similarly, the size of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* cannot be known until its signature is obtained. Changing the size of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* after file layout is completed would invalidate the file offsets contained within the data hash assertion.

In this case, it is necessary to use a _<<_placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion>>_ to reserve space for the content of the final *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* (including its signature) which will be created later.

When using a data hash assertion, a _<<C2PA claim generator>>_ MUST follow the process described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_creating_a_claim++[Section 10.3, “Creating a claim,”] and link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_multiple_step_processing++[Section 10.4, “Multiple step processing,”] of the C2PA technical specification with additional steps as described below:

1. link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_creating_assertions++[Section 10.3.1, “Creating assertions.”] Any *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* that will be added to the claim MUST be represented during this step by an assertion using the same label as the final *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.* The content of the _<<_placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion>>_ is unimportant, except that the size in bytes of the _<<_placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion>>_ MUST be large enough to accommodate the final *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*

7. The list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>_ (including the _<<_hard_binding,hard binding>>_ assertion) MUST be presented to the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ for each *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* to be added, as described in xref:_presenting_the_list_of_referenced_assertions_for_signature[xrefstyle=full] by the corresponding _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>._ Once each signature has been obtained, the _<<_placeholder_assertion,placeholder assertion>>_ content MUST be replaced with the final *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* content incorporating that signature. The _<<C2PA claim generator>>_ SHOULD independently validate the signature from the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ before proceeding.
8. The remaining steps from link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_multiple_step_processing++[Section 10.4, “Multiple step processing,”] MUST now be completed.

== Validating the identity assertion

=== Validation method

IMPORTANT: Validation of the _<<C2PA Manifest>>_ MUST be completed with a finding that the manifest is at least _well-formed_ as per link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_well_formed_manifest++[Section 14.3.2, Well-formed manifest,”] of the C2PA technical specification before a validator attempts to report on the validity of an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*

An *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* MUST contain valid CBOR that satisfies the `identity` rule in xref:_schema_and_example[xrefstyle=full]. The `cawg.identity.cbor.invalid` error code SHALL be used to report assertions that do not follow this rule.

For each entry in the `referenced_assertions` field, the validator MUST verify that the same entry exists in either the `created_assertions` or `gathered_assertions` entry of the _<<C2PA claim>>._ (For version 1 claims, the entry must appear in the `assertions` entry.) The `cawg.identity.assertion.mismatch` error code SHALL be used to report violations of this rule.

The validator MUST ensure that the `referenced_assertions` field contains at least one _<<_hard_binding,hard binding>>_ assertion as described in link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hard_bindings++[Section 9.2, “Hard bindings”] of the C2PA technical specification. The `cawg.identity.hard_binding_missing` error code SHALL be used to report a missing _<<_hard_binding,hard binding>>_ assertion.

The `sig_type` field of an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* MUST contain one of the values described in xref:_credentials_signatures_and_validation_methods[xrefstyle=full]. The `cawg.identity.sig_type.invalid` error code SHALL be used to report assertions that contain unrecognized values.

The `signature` field of an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* MUST contain a valid signature. The procedure for validating each signature type and corresponding status codes are described in xref:_credentials_signatures_and_validation_methods[xrefstyle=full].

The `pad1` and `pad2` fields of an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* MUST contain only zero-value (`0x00`) bytes. The `cawg.identity.pad.invalid` error code SHALL be used to report assertions that contain other values in these fields.

=== Status codes

The set of standard success and failure codes for *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* validations are defined below. These follow the format defined by the section titled link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_status_codes++[Section 15.1, “Status codes,”] of the C2PA technical specification.

The `url` field for a status code MUST always be the label of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.* It is omitted from the tables below.

==== Success codes

[width="100%",cols="4,10",options="header"]
|=======================
| Value        |   Meaning
|`cawg.identity.validated` | The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* including the referenced credentials and signature binding the credential holder to the _<<C2PA claim>>_, is validated.
|=======================

==== Failure codes

[width="100%",cols="4,10",options="header"]
|=======================
| Value        |   Meaning
|`cawg.identity.cbor.invalid` | The CBOR of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* is not valid.
|`cawg.identity.assertion.mismatch` | The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* contains an assertion reference that could not be found in the _<<C2PA claim>>.
|`cawg.identity.hard_binding_missing` | The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* does not reference a _<<_hard_binding,hard binding>>_ assertion.
|`cawg.identity.sig_type.invalid` | The `sig_type` of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* is not valid.
|`cawg.identity.pad.invalid` | The `pad1` or `pad2` field contains non-zero bytes.
|=======================

NOTE: Additional failure codes relating to specific signature types are defined in xref:_credentials_signatures_and_validation_methods[xrefstyle=full].

== Credentials, signatures, and validation methods

The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* allows multiple signature types to be represented, although only one _<<ToIP verifiable identifier>>_ and corresponding signature can be used in any single assertion.

The signature type is represented by the `sig_type` field and must be one of the values described within this section.

=== W3C verifiable credentials

==== Verifiable credential overview

In some use cases, an _<<_actor,actor>>_ in the system MAY wish to provide its own _<<W3C verifiable credential>>,_ as it exists at that moment in time, to the _<<C2PA claim generator>>_ to have it associated with one or more _<<_c2pa-assertion,C2PA assertions>>._ This _<<_actor,actor>>_ MAY be an individual, group, or organization.

IMPORTANT: The _<<W3C verifiable credential>>_ is not itself directly embedded in the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* but is instead used to create a new _<<W3C verifiable credential>>_ describing the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject’s>>_ role in the specific _<<C2PA asset>>_ being described.

The `credentialSubject` of this _<<W3C verifiable credential>>_ MUST contain only a single `credentialSubject` and that `credentialSubject` shall have an `id` value, which MUST be a valid _https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/[W3C decentralized identifier]._ Additional requirements for this _https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/[W3C decentralized identifier]_ are stated in _xref:_did_method_requirements[xrefstyle=full]._

As defined in link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#resolution++[Section 7, “Resolution,”] of the W3C decentralized identifier specification, the result of _resolving_ a _<<W3C decentralized identifier>>_ is a _<<W3C decentralized identifier document>>,_ in this case a set of data describing the _<<_actor,actor>>_ whose _<<W3C verifiable credential>>_ was presented.

The _<<C2PA claim generator>>_ prepares the list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>_ to be presented to the _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>,_ which MUST in turn respond with a new _<<_verifiable_credential,verifiable credential>>._ Additional requirements for this new credential are stated in xref:_verifiable_credential_requirements[xrefstyle=full].

NOTE: The interaction between the _<<C2PA claim generator>>_ and _<<_credential_subject,credential subject>>_ is outside the scope of this specification. Claim generators MAY wish to use a protocol such as link:https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/[OpenID for verifiable credentials] to obtain a compliant _<<W3C verifiable credential>>_.

The relationships among _<<_actor,actor>>,_ _<<W3C verifiable credential>>,_ _<<W3C decentralized identifier document>>,_ and the list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>_ are illustrated in the following diagram, which is non-normative:

[mermaid,width=100%]
....
erDiagram
  A[Actor] {
    string private_key
  }

  AVC["Actor’s verifiable credential"] {
    string credentialSubject_id "(did:method:xxx)"
  }

  DID_DOC["DID document"] {
    struct assertionMethod
  }

  ASSERTION["Referenced assertions"] {}

  CVC["Asset’s verifiable credential"] {}

  A ||--|| AVC : "controls via private key"
  AVC ||--|| DID_DOC : "references via DID method"
  CVC||--o{ ASSERTION: "references"
  CVC ||--|| AVC: "references"
  A ||--|| CVC: "generates new credential"
....

Once the asset’s verifiable credential has been obtained, the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* can be formed. The `sig_type` value for such an assertion MUST be `org.w3.verifiable_credential` and the `signature` value MUST be the *asset’s* _<<W3C verifiable credential>>_ serialized as described in link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-ld++[Section 6.2, “JSON-LD,”] of the W3C verifiable credentials data model spec. Further requirements for the _verifiable credential_ are described in xref:_verifiable_credential_requirements[xrefstyle=full].

NOTE: JSON-LD serialization is mandated as it is the most commonly used of the three syntaxes presented in link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#syntaxes++[Section 6, “Syntaxes,”] of the W3C verifiable credentials specification. It is also the one that aligns best with its extensibility model, which could be useful to some implementers.

[#compliant-credential-example]
NOTE: TO DO (link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/issues/17[issue #17]): Build an example of a compliant credential.

==== DID method requirements

As defined in link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods++[Section 8, “Methods,”] of the W3C decentralized identifier spec, a _DID method_ defines how implementers can create, resolve, update, and deactivate _<<_w3c_decentralized_identifier,W3C decentralized identifiers>>,_ and _<<W3C decentralized identifier document>>._

The _DID method_ chosen SHOULD satisfy the following requirements, which are chosen to align with the Trust Over IP concept of _<<_verifiable_identifier,verifiable identifier>>:_

* The method for _DID resolution_ (see link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-resolution++[Section 7.1, “DID Resolution,”] of the W3C decentralized identifiers specification) SHOULD be publicly specified.
* The method for _DID resolution_ MUST support independent discovery and verification of cryptographic keys associated with the DID.

==== DID document requirements

The _<<W3C decentralized identifier document>>_ for the _<<_c2pa_actor,C2PA actor,>>_ which is located by resolving the _<<W3C decentralized identifier>>_ from the _<<W3C verifiable credential>>,_ and MUST confirm to the requirements stated in link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#representations++[Section 6, “Representations,”] of the W3C decentralized identifier specification.

In addition, the _<<W3C decentralized identifier document>>_ MUST contain an `assertionMethod` field as defined by link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#assertion__[Section 5.3.2, “Assertion,”] of the W3C decentralized identifiers specification.

An example of a compliant _<<W3C decentralized identifier document>>_ is shown in the example below, which is non-normative:

NOTE: TO DISCUSS (link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/issues/18[issue #18]): Do we wish to have any further restrictions on verification methods beyond those specified in link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#verification-material++[Section 5.2.1, “Verification material,”] of the DID spec? See also link:++https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#verification-method-types++[Section 6.1, “Verification method types,”] of the W3C DID specification registries document for a list of possible verification methods. Currently about 10 are listed.

NOTE: TO DO (link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/issues/19[issue #19]): Specify structure, including how list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>_ is expressed in the verifiable credential.

==== Validating an identity assertion with a W3C verifiable credential

An *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* with `sig_type` of `org.w3.verifiable_credential` is only valid if the following conditions have been successfully verified:

[#vc-validation-failure-status-codes]
NOTE: TO DO (link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/issues/20[issue #20]): Add status codes for reporting validation failures for each of these conditions. Add links to relevant specs.

* The *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* structure itself is valid as described in xref:_validation_method.
* The `signature` field must contain a valid JSON-LD serialization of a _<<W3C verifiable credential>>._
* The _<<W3C verifiable credential>>_ must satisfy all requirements stated in xref:_verifiable_credential_requirements.
* The list of  _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>_ in the asset’s _<<W3C verifiable credential>>_ must match the assertions referenced in the `referenced_assertions` field of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* structure.
* The _<<W3C decentralized identifier document>>_ referenced in the asset’s _<<W3C verifiable credential>>_ is successfully resolved and contains public key cryptographic material as required by xref:_did_document_requirements[].
* The `proof` in the asset’s _<<W3C verifiable credential>>_ indicated a valid signature for the public key cryptographic material in the _<<W3C decentralized identifier document>>_ and the list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>._

[IMPORTANT]
.DID method support
====
This specification does not restrict the _DID methods_ that a _<<C2PA claim generator>>_ may use when generating an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* nor does it require a _<<C2PA Manifest Consumer>>_ to consume any particular _DID methods._

It is RECOMMENDED that validators be prepared to resolve the following DID methods at a minimum:

* https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/[`did:web`]
* https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-did-method-webs-specification/[`did:webs`]

Validators MAY wish to use a service such as the link:++https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver++[DIF universal resolver] to enable interoperability with a wide variety of DID methods.
====

=== X.509 certificates and COSE signatures

In some use cases, an _<<_actor,actor>>_ in the system may wish to provide an _https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280[X.509 certificate]_ to have an organizational or individual identity described by the certificate associated with the list of _<<_referenced_assertions,referenced assertions>>._

The `sig_type` value for such an assertion MUST be `org.ietf.cose`. The `signature` value MUST be a _https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152[COSE signature]_ as described below.

==== Generating the COSE signature

To generate the COSE signature for an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* the steps described in the listed sections of the C2PA technical specification MUST be followed with adaptations as described subsequently:

* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_signing_a_claim++[Section 10.3.2.4, “Signing a claim”]
* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_time_stamps++[Section 10.3.2.5, “Time-stamps”]

* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_digital_signatures++[Section 13.2, “Digital signatures”]

In each of the above sections, the following changes MUST be applied:

* Any reference to the _claim_ MUST be replaced with the CBOR serialization of the `referenced_assertions` field from the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*
* Any reference to the _claim generator_ MUST be replaced with the _<<_actor,actor>>_ whose _X.509 certificate_ is being used for this assertion.

[#review-x509-usage]

====
* Is the EKU usage still valid for this purpose?
* Is the trust list the same?
====

==== Validating the COSE signature

To validate the COSE signature for an *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>,* the steps described in the listed sections of the C2PA technical specification MUST be followed with adaptations as described:

* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validate_the_signature++[Section 15.4, “Validate the signature.”] Disregard the paragraph that starts with “Retrieve the URI reference.” Instead retrieve the COSE signature from the `signature` field of the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*
* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validate_the_time_stamp++[Section 15.5, “Validate the time-stamp”]
* link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validate_the_credential_revocation_information++[Section 15.6, “Validate the credential revocation information”]

In each of the above sections, the following changes MUST be applied:

* Any reference to the _claim_ MUST be replaced with the CBOR serialization of the `referenced_assertions` field from the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*
* Any reference to the _claim generator_ MUST be replaced with the _<<_actor,actor>>_ whose _X.509 certificate_ is being used for this assertion.

== Trust model

IMPORTANT: This section augments link:++https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_trust_model++[Section 14, “Trust model,”] of the C2PA spec by adding additional trust signals related to the identity of _<<_actor,actors>>_ involved in creation of a _<<C2PA asset>>._ It does not replace any portion of the C2PA trust model.

[#define-trust-model]
[NOTE]
.TO DO (link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/issues/22[issue #22]): Define the trust model.
====
Add language here that clarifies that the *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>* introduces a second trust triangle, distinct from the trust triangle including the _claim generator,_ that enables the C2PA Manifest Consumer to make trust decisions regarding the _actor_ whose credential was used to generate the signature in this *<<_identity_assertion,identity assertion>>.*
