# Scope

This document outlines the scope of work undertaken by the Content Authenticity Initiative Identity Assertion Working Group.

## Objectives

The objective of this Working Group is to document a new identity assertion specification.

The identity assertion should allow an actor (typically an individual human or an organization of humans) to document their relationship to a C2PA asset produced by them or on their behalf independently from the C2PA claim generator, and to allow consumers of a C2PA asset to independently verify that the received asset was in fact produced by the named actor and has not been tampered with.

This is to be viewed as an additional trust signal over and above the trust signals defined in the core C2PA Technical Specification.

It is a non-goal of this Working Group to alter the core C2PA Technical Specification in any way or to replace the trust signals provided therein.

## Membership and joining

## Deliverables

This Working Group shall produce a version 1.0 of an identity assertion specification which shall reflect the consensus of the members at that time. The Working Group may produce subsequent versions of the specification.

## Meeting schedule and notes

Meetings of the Identity Assertion Working Group are held on Mondays at 08:30 Pacific for 90 minutes until the 1.0 specification is approved. The group shall re-evaluate the meeting schedule as of the 1.0 specification release.

TO DO: Define meeting notes (hosted in this repo?) and meeting logistics.

## Dependencies

The identity assertion specification must align with the C2PA Technical Specification that is current as of the time of publication.
